##Eth-Vim

It's pretty much a repo made around the makefile that gives my vim the IDE functionality that is missing from vim for ethereum dev.<br/>

Just copy the makefile to your work directory, read the help and use it.<br/>

This is what i personally use, so it doesn't really do anything beyond what I need it to do but I wouldn't mind adding stuff in.<br/>
